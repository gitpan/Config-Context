Revision history for Config-Context

0.09    2005-Aug-12
        - fixed a bug in the tests for testing module prerequisites
        - it is now possible to run the test suite while simulating the
          absense of specific config modules.  To run the test suite
          multiple times (each with a different selection of absent
          modules), run:

             $ perl misc/prove_without_modules.pl t/*.t

          To customize this process, see the instructions at the top of
          misc/prove_without_modules.pl

0.08    2005-May-??
        - documentation fixes

0.07    2005-May-06
        - improved error messages when one or more of a driver's
          prerequisite modules are missing

0.06    2005-May-04
        - Minor documentation fixes
        - config option to new:
          - removed the requirement to specify a driver
          - added test case
        - added 'files' method
        - changed Config::General feature detection
        - suppress warnings that appear under "perl -w" but not under
          "use warnings" (for removing warnings during test suite)
        - changed 'lower_case_names' in Config::Context::XMLSimple from
          an error to a warning
        - fixed XMLSimple driver so that system fails gracefully when
          XML modules are not installed
        - fixed tests to detect all prereqs of driver, instead of just
          a single module (this was done mostly for XML::Simple which
          depends on three modules)
